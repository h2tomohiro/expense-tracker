# What is your project about
With our app, you can track your incomes and expenses and always be aware of your current money situation.

# What are you using this project for / What is the purpose of this project
For us, this project was about gaining more confidence and knowledge in using React and its features, understanding state management processes and discovering styling possibilities in React.

# Why did you decide to make this project?
In the beginning, we wanted to create a weather app. However, as soon as we came across an expense tracker app, we immediately changed our minds. The reason probably is that neither I nor Tomo are able to continue tracking our finances once we start.

# What reference did you use?
